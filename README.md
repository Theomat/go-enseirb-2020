# go-enseirb-2020

Reimplementation of AlphaGoZero [1].


## Files

This branch is used for a variant of the AlphaGo Zero.
The network used only output the probabilities of the moves.
And then we build MCTS on top of those probabilitites but without any rollouts.

The file ```mcts_nn_player.py``` along with the ```model.pt``` can be used to have a working player.
We believe it's quite good but not up to par with the full algorithm.
